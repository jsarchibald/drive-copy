# drive-copy
Copy directories recursively in Google Drive. Good for re-establishing permissions (to you as owner) and making persistent copies of files created by others in a shared Drive folder.

## Usage

`python main.py SOURCE_ID DEST_ID` where `SOURCE_ID` is the ID (found in the URL bar) of the source folder, and `DEST_ID` is the ID (found in the URL bar) of the destination folder.
